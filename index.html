      Osmanthus fragrans bloom when the summer is over and the weather gets a little cooler. The
      flowers are orange, very small, and give off a sweet, mellow fragrance. The scent is so
      strong, especially at night, that you can smell it even if you are not near it. The genus
      name, Osmanthus, is derived from the Greek words osme (meaning "smell") and anthos (meaning
      "flower"). The trunk is thick and well branched, reaching a height of about 4 meters. The
      leaves are 5-9 cm long, leathery, and have a slightly yellowish underside. The flowers are
      dioecious, with four rows of sepals and four deep corollas, two stamens and one pistil. Sweet
      Olive is a popular garden tree because it grows well in the shade and is easy to grow even for
      beginners.
